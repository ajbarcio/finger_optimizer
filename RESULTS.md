# RESULTS:

Please note best grips are reported in units relative to max pulley radius and tendon force
Maximum pulley radius is normalized to unitless 1 unless otherwise noted
Maximum force         is normalized to unitless 1 unless otherwise noted

## For 2:1 flexion to extension ratio:

### Type 1:

Best grip magnitude: 3.741
Pulley radii:
[[ 1.     1.     1.    -0.875]
 [ 0.     1.     1.    -0.375]
 [ 0.     0.     1.    -0.125]]
(Objective to maximize flexure grip strength)

Best grip magnitude: 1.590
Pulley Radii:
[[ 0.971  0.033  0.151 -0.568]
 [ 0.     0.968  0.141 -0.531]
 [ 0.     0.     0.953 -0.42 ]]
(Objective to maximize individual joint flexure ability)
NOTE: this wants to approach a diagonal matrix with the trivial solution:
[[ 1.     0.     0.    -0.5]
 [ 0.     1.     0.    -0.5]
 [ 0.     0.     1.    -0.5]]
(duh)

### Type 2:

best grip magnitude: 3.741
Pulley radii:

[[ 0.944 -0.47   0.844 -0.878]
 [ 0.    -0.243  1.078 -0.85 ]
 [ 0.     0.     0.974 -0.974]]
Note: Only succeeds in one axis. Impossible?
